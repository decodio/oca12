This module adds the possibility to automatically unreserve currently reserved
pickings in order to assign some currently unreserved picking.

**Table of contents**

   :local:

Configuration
=============

By default, the forced reservation is rolled back if the picking to reserve
cannot be satisfied fully, and the user is presented with a warning message.
To allow partial forced reservation, change the value of the system setting
`stock_picking_force_assign.allow_partial` to `True`. This entails that no
message is displayed when no assignment, or only a partial assignment was
possible.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. add some user to the group `Force reservation on pickings`
#. those users will see a button `Force reservation` on the picking form next to
   `Check availability` which will either unreserve pickings from the current
   location and assign the picking, or raise of it's not possible to unreserve
   enough stock.
