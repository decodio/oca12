This module allows you to set the End of Life Date of a Product.

Products with EoL Date in the past are excluded from the list of Products in Purchase Order so the product can not be ordered.

A scheduled action is created to know in advance the list of products whose EoL Date is approaching.
An email will be sent to the members of the Discussion Channel for Product Eol Notification Group.
