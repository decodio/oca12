This module adds support on mrp manufacturing orders for the MTS+MTO rule from
stock_mts_mto_rule module (from https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse)

You can then configure a pick before manufacture route which will only pick if
there is no stock left in the source location of the manufacturing order.
