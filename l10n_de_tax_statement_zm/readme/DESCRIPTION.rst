This module extends the *German VAT Statement* module (Umsatzsteuervoranmeldung), by adding the statement for the *Intra-Community transactions declaration* (Zusammenfassende Meldung).

This report is based on the line *Steuerfr. Umsätze mit Vorsteuerabz. innerg. Lieferungen (§4 Nr. 1b) an Abnehmer mit USt-ID (41)* and *Nicht steuerb. sonst. Leist. gem. § 18b S. 1 Nr. 2 (21)* of the German VAT Statement report.
The period is also the same as the one selected in the VAT statement report.

This additional VAT declaration report includes:

* the VAT identification numbers of your customers
* the total amount of intra-Community supplies from Germany for every customer during the selected period
* The values for product deliveries and services are separated in two columns.
* If you want to transmit the values to the official report form, f.e. by "www.elster.de" you would have to go to the second tab of odoo’s tax statement form where you can see all the lines you would have to declare to the german tax authorities for the selected period. If you click on „Download.CSV“ you will get the file you may upload on the 2nd side of the declaration form „Zusammenfassende Meldung“ on the official tax declaration portal „www.elster.de“. As another option you may enter the valaues by hand, however you would have to enter two lines if both columns product + services on the tab „Zusammenfassende Meldung“ contains values.
