This module displays the description fields on backend for :
* surveys
* pages
* questions

and thank you field for surveys.

Note: these fields are present in code, displayed on front-end for survey (when defined) but not displayed on backend for user to fill.
A PR has been submitted to Odoo (https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/52329) to implement this in Odoo 12.0 code, but since survey module has been refactored in v13.0 it may never be merged, so this module was created.
