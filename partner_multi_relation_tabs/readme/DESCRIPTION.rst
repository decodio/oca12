This module adds the possibility to show certain partner relations in a
tab on the partner form, in addition to in the list of all relations.

This can be useful if certain relation types are regularly used and should
be overseeable at a glace.

For instance you can make a tab named 'board' that will show all the board
members of a company, by showing the relations of types ceo, cto, cfo and
board member.
