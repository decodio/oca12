To configure this module, you need to:

#. Log in.
#. Go to `your website events page </event>`_.
#. Open the *Customize* menu.
#. Enable *Images and Description*, and you should see events with
   an image and description in the layout.

.. warning::
    Normal (not highlighted) events will show up a bit clunky if you do not
    disable the *Filters* view from the *Customize* menu.

    You can either highlight all events, or disable that view.

    If you still need filters, see module ``website_event_filter_selector``
    found in this same repo.
