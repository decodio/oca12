To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to the events page in your website. They have image and description now.

You will notice that short description is the excerpt of the first 80
characters of the event's long description. If you want to set a manual
description, you need to:

- From the frontend:
    #. Click in that event.
    #. Use the *Promote > Optimize SEO* tool to set a meta description.
- From the backend:
    #. Go to *Events > Events*.
    #. Choose one.
    #. Go to *Featured content*.
    #. Use the *Website meta description* field for the same purpose.

If you want to change the image, you need to:

#. Edit the event page.
#. There, the first image appearing will be the one chosen. Beware, background
   images count!

If you want to set an event as important:

#. Go to the event's form in backend.
#. Publish it.
#. Go to the *Featured content* tab.
#. Add a star in *Priority* to display the event in a full row on website.
#. Remove the star to display it in half a row.
