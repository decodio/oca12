No extra configuration is required, yet it is possible to exclude specific
contract from the Employee Cost computation by marking the contact with
"Exclude from Employee Cost" checkbox.

To change how cost is computed:
#. Go to *Configuration > Settings > Timesheet Options*
#. Configure **Employee's Timesheet Cost policy** accordingly.

This module also supports optional integration with ``hr_contract_rate``
module that allows configuring contract rate with more variety of options: e.g.
hourly, monthly, etc. rates.
