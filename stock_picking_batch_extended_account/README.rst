field of the partners for whom you want the invoice to be automatically
generated when any batch that has a 'Picking' to which they belong is
set to 'done' state.

#. Go to each of thoes partner, edit them, find 'Batch picking auto invoice'
   field under 'Sales & Purchase' tab and check it.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Inventory > Batch Picking*.
#. Create a new batch and add some pickings such that their partners
   have the option 'Batch picking auto invoice' checked
   (See configuration section). Make sure the selected pickings are
   linked to a sales order.
#. Confirm the batch.
#. Set the batch to 'done' state. After that, invoices will be generated
   for all sales orders linked to the pickings of the batch.
#. Click on 'Print Invoices' button in the status bar and you will see a PDF
   report for all the generated invoices.
