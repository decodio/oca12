This module allows you to easily compute the accrued revenue and accrued expenses based on the **Start Date** and **End Date** of journal items (copied from the same fields of invoice lines) and to generate the related cutoff journal items.

For example, imagine that you have an activity where you invoice at the begining of each quarter the period corresponding to the previous quarter. So, on January 10th 2018, you generate customer invoices for the period running from October 1st 2017 to December 31st 2017. If your fiscal year ends on December 31st, you will need to provision in 2017 the revenue that is invoiced in 2018 that cover 2017. With this module, you will create an *Accrued Revenue* on December 31st 2017 and Odoo will identify the customer invoices that are dated after December 31st 2017 and that cover a period before December 31st 2017 (totally or in part).
