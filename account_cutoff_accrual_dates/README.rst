This module allows you to easily compute the accrued revenue and accrued expenses based on the **Start Date** and **End Date** of journal items (copied from the same fields of invoice lines) and to generate the related cutoff journal items.

For example, imagine that you have an activity where you invoice at the begining of each quarter the period corresponding to the previous quarter. So, on January 10th 2018, you generate customer invoices for the period running from October 1st 2017 to December 31st 2017. If your fiscal year ends on December 31st, you will need to provision in 2017 the revenue that is invoiced in 2018 that cover 2017. With this module, you will create an *Accrued Revenue* on December 31st 2017 and Odoo will identify the customer invoices that are dated after December 31st 2017 and that cover a period before December 31st 2017 (totally or in part).

Configuration
=============

On the Accounting configuration page available via the menu *Invoicing > Configuration > Settings*, there is a *Cut-offs* section where you can configure:

* the *Default Cut-off Journal*, which is the journal in which the cut-off journal items will be generated by default,
* the *Default Account for Accrued Revenue*,
* the *Default Account for Accrued Expense*.

Usage
=====

To compute the accrued revenue, go to the menu *Invoicing > Cut-offs
> Accrued Revenue* and click on the *Create* button. Enter the cut-off
date, check that the source journals contains all your sale journals
and click on the button *Re-Generate lines*: Odoo will scan all the
journal entries of the source journals and will get all the lines that
have a start date before or equal to the cut-off date and, for each line, it will
compute the revenue to provision. If you agree with the result, click on the
button *Create Journal Entry*: Odoo will generate an account move at the
cut-off date to provision these revenue. Hint: you can then use the reversal
feature to generate the reverse journal items on the next day.
