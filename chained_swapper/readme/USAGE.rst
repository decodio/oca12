To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to the source document in list mode.
#. Select one or several records.
#. Click on Action and locate the option "Chained swap: <name of the swap>".
#. If one of the selected records doesn't comply with one of the constraints,
   a message will be shown, and the swap won't continue.
#. If everything is OK, a popup will arise, and you will see a field for
   filling the new value.
#. Click on "Change", and the swap will be done.
#. On the chatter of the source document, an entry will be logged for
   reflecting the done swap.
