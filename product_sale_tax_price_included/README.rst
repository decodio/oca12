**According to the customer taxes** of the product (choosen in accouting part), there are 4 possibilities :

- The sale price **AND** the sale price without taxes are displayed.

- **Or** the sale price **AND** the sale price with taxes.

- **Or** if you choose two customer taxes, one included in price, and the other
  one not included in price, this module displays the sale price and the two
  calculated prices.
