Configuration
=============

Nothing to configure, just check the demo user.

Usage
=====

Log in as the demo user, and observe on the upper right of the screen the widgets for profile selection and company selection.
Use the widgets to manipulate user profile and companies for dynamic permissions/roles editing.

Note: "Merchant Profile" means the user is interested in sales and purchases, and thus has access only to those menus. Note that through configuration of roles and role lines, a merchant can be a sales user AND a purchase user in one company, or just a sales user (NOT a purchase user) in another company.

Here is a walkthrough:

* Demo user starts in "YourCompany" company. Observe permissions and access to the root menus for sales and purchases.
* Switch profile to HR profile, which gives access only to HR permissions. Observe that you can create new employees.
* Switch company to "Company, The Second". Observe the menu has been reset, profile options have changed, one has been picked automatically from the available ones.
* Switch profile to "Merchant Profile". Observe that for this company, you can only access Sales, because only a Sales role line has been defined for this company and user.
* Switch profile to "ERP Settings profile". Observe that as expected you have ERP manager permissions.
