Configuration
=============

Products can be automatically converted into Fleet Vehicle.
This is only available only for products tracked by serial number.
This needs to be enabled both on Operation Types and Products.
For example, we may want to create the Fleet Vehicle on Delivery,
or on Receipts.

To enable on Products:

* Go to Inventory > Master Data > Products
* Open the Product form, Inventory tab
* On the "Traceability" section, make sure
  "Tracking" is set to "By Unique Serial Number"
* Enable the "Creates Fleet Vehicle" checkbox
* Open Fleet tab
* Select Fleet Vehicle Model

To enable on Operation Types:

* Go to Inventory > Configuration > Operation Types
* Select the intended Operation Type ("Receipts" for example)
* On the "Traceability" section, enable the
  "Create Fleet Vehicle" checkbox

Usage
=====

A completed stock move for a properly configured Product on a configured
stock Operation Type will automatically create a fleet vehicle.
