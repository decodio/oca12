This module allows the Billing Manager to navigate the amounts in the chart
of accounts across the first two levels of the account group hierarchy plus
the account level.

**Table of contents**

Installation
============

To allow the user to browse through the first two levels of the chart of account
codes, this module adds two dedicated columns to the journal item table to
store top level, and the top - 1 level of the account group hierarchy that the
journal item belongs to. The columns are populated automatically during the
installation of the module. The installation will take about 2 minutes for every
million move lines in your database.

Configuration
=============

In order to enable the pseudohierachy that this module exposes in its move
line pivot view, you need to configure the account group on all accounts in
your chart of accounts.

Usage
=====

Go to Invoicing -> Reporting -> Management -> Journal Item Drilldown to browse
journal items across the first two levels of the account group hierarchy plus
the account level.

By default, you will get a pivot view with the three levels expanded:

The three levels are: the top level of the account.group hierarchy,
the top - 1 level of the account.group hierarchy, and the account
itself. You can easily collapse a level by deselecting them in the `Group By`
dropdown in the search bar.

You can also browse the journal items by switching to the tree view and click
through the grouping levels in that view.
