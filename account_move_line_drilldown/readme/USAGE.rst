Go to Invoicing -> Reporting -> Management -> Journal Item Drilldown to browse
journal items across the first two levels of the account group hierarchy plus
the account level.

By default, you will get a pivot view with the three levels expanded:

The three levels are: the top level of the account.group hierarchy,
the top - 1 level of the account.group hierarchy, and the account
itself. You can easily collapse a level by deselecting them in the `Group By`
dropdown in the search bar.

You can also browse the journal items by switching to the tree view and click
through the grouping levels in that view.
