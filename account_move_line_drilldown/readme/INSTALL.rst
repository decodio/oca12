To allow the user to browse through the first two levels of the chart of account
codes, this module adds two dedicated columns to the journal item table to
store top level, and the top - 1 level of the account group hierarchy that the
journal item belongs to. The columns are populated automatically during the
installation of the module. The installation will take about 2 minutes for every
million move lines in your database.
