For leading with variable periods and prorate, only weekly, monthly or yearly
periods are allowed. When you create an invoice with a membership product
with variable period, the theoretical period is calculated from the invoice
date (or today if empty) as the natural period of the selected unit that
includes that date. For example, if the invoice is on the 15th of January
and the unit is month, the theoretical period to invoice will be all the month
of January.
