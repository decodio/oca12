This module allows to relate German state NUTS level 2 locations with the
German states defined by localization.

* German states (NUTS level 2) related with Partner State

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

After installation, you must click at import wizard to populate NUTS items
in Odoo database in:
Sales > Configuration > Address Book > Import NUTS 2013

This wizard will download from Europe RAMON service the metadata to
build NUTS in Odoo. Each localization addon (l10n_es_location_nuts,
l10n_de_location_nuts, ...) will inherit this wizard and
relate each NUTS item with states. So if you install a new localization addon
you must re-build NUTS clicking this wizard again.

Usage
=====

Only Administrator can manage NUTS list (it is not neccesary because
it is an European convention) but any registered user can read them,
in order to allow to assign them to partner object.
