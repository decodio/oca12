To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to menu Project > Search > Tasks and create a new task, and you get a
new code saving it.
#. If you duplicate a task, you will get a new code for the new task.

The Task code is not editable in the Task form,
but it is available when importing files.
This allows to create a specific task numbering in a spreadsheet
and then import them into Odoo.
