This module extends the fleet management functionality. Allows the registration of the vehicle's calendar year.

One example is the difference between the use of "model-year" and "calendar-year" in describing the year of a fleet vehicle. Most of the world uses calendar-year to designate a vehicle date; however, the U.S., Mexico, and Canada use model-year.
