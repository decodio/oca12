Define Documentation sets for Products.

These can be used, for example, to send to customers
along with Quotations or Sale orders.

Product Documentation Sets can be defined on Products or Product Categories,
by purpose, country and language, and can have several versions.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, go to
Sales > Configuration > Sale Orders > Product Documentation
and create the product Documentation Sets to be used for each countries and languages.

The Countries and Languages field are optional.
If no terms are found for a particular Country and Language combination,
a lookup will be done for Terms with only that Country, and then for only
that Language.

For best results, ensure that Customers have the Country and Language set.

The Product documentation can be used in Sale Orders,
if the ``sale_product_documentation_set`` is installed.

Usage
=====

In a Product or Product Category, a Documentation Sets field is available.
