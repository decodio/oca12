To use this module, you need to:

#. Select the paazl carrier on your sale orders or pickings
#. Set exactly one delivery option
#. As a label needs to be generated for the tracking code, there's no need to manually generate labels via the button
#. Note that the addon passes the package's dimensions if a packaging is set on the package, and on the product's dimensions otherwise
