The standard Odoo application "Leaves" allows end users to create
leave allocations and leave requests with duration expressed in days or in
hours, depending on the configuration set in the leave types.
However in the leave summary report, in the employee form and in some other
places, the duration is displayed in days regardless of the configuration of
the leave type.
This is confusing for the customers that are used to manage leaves in hours.


By installing this module, the duration will be displayed in hours in the following views:

- Leaves Summary
- Leaves Left (smart button in Employee form)
- Remaining Legal Leaves (field in Employee form)
