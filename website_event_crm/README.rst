This module extends the functionality of website events and CRM to support
inviting customers to register to events of the selected category and to allow
you to have less administrative work to do, mostly if they register by
themselves.

Installation
============

To install this module, you need to:

#. Install crm_event from https://github.com/OCA/event

Configuration
=============

This module allows you to configure opportunity stages to enable some automations.

To advance automatically to the next stage when the opportunity is invited to view an event category on the website:

#. Go to *CRM > Sales > My pipeline*.

#. Hover over one stage name and click on its cogs icon.

#. Choose *Edit Stage*.

#. Enable *Invite automatically to website event category* if you want that
   opportunities in that stage, which are related to an event category, get
   periodically checked to see if there's a new event published in your website,
   belonging to that category, and, if so, invited to check it out.

#. Enable *Advance stage automatically when inviting to website event category*
   if you want that, when one of the opportunities in that stage is invited to
   check out events published on your website, it advances automatically to the
   next stage.

Important: If you don't want to invite automatically on loop, make sure to
enable both options if you enable the 1st one, and make sure the next stage is
not enabled to autonotify.

To configure the frequency of automated notifications:

#. Go to *Settings > Technical > Automation > Scheduled Actions >
   Notify all opportunities related to event categories*.

#. Edit *Execute Every*.

Important: That only schedules mails, but they will be sent later when the
*Mail: Email Queue Manager* automated action is triggered. You can configure it
the same way.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to *CRM > Sales > My pipeline* and create one opportunity.

#. Assign an event type and a customer to it. The event type must:

   * Have at least one published event.
   * With available seats.
   * Which is upcoming.

#. Click on *Invite to website*. You will see a wizard to send an email to the
   customer, inviting him/her to visit your website and register to an event.
