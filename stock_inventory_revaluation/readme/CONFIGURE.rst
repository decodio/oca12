* Users wanting to access to the Inventory Revaluation menu should be
  members of the group "Manage Inventory Valuation and Costing Methods".

* The Revaluation can automatically select contra-accounts to the Stock
  Valuation Account.  To configure this, define a Valuation Increase Account
  and a Valuation Decrease Account for each product category. Do that here:
  *Inventory / Configuration / Products / Product Categories*
