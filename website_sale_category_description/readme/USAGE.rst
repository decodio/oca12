To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to `your eCommerce </shop>`__.
#. Click on *Customize*.
#. Enable *eCommerce Categories* if it was disabled.
#. Navigate to any category.
#. Click on *Edit*.
#. You will see an additional block drop area below the search box, which you
   can edit differently by category.
#. Drag and drop blocks as usual. Make sure you drop them in the correct area,
   because there are also one top and one bottom drop areas which are shared
   among all eCommerce pages.
