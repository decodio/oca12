To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to your blog.
#. Disable the cover image from *Customize > Blog Posts > Cover image*
   to avoid having too many images, and possibly repeated ones.
#. Enable the template from *Customize > Blog Posts >
   Floating social share image* if it is not enabled by default.
#. Your posts will now display a thumbnail of the chosen social share image.

This module also will autoselect the 1st image in the blog content as
the social share image, if there's no post cover and the publisher didn't
choose a different one manually, from the *Promote > Optimize SEO* wizard.
