This module adds a field *UNECE Payment Mean* on *Payment Methods* to be able
to use a standard written by the
`United Nations Economic Commission for Europe <http://www.unece.org>`_ (which
has 56 members states in Europe, America and Central Asia, cf
`Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Economic_Commission_for_Europe>`_).
This standard define a codification of the payment modes, cf the
`official code list <http://www.unece.org/trade/untdid/d99b/tred/tred4461.htm>`_.

This codification is used for example in the two main international standards
for electronic invoicing:

* `Cross Industry Invoice <http://tfig.unece.org/contents/cross-industry-invoice-cii.htm>`_ (CII),
* `Universal Business Language <http://ubl.xml.org/>`_ (UBL)
