To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Sales > Configuration > Settings* and *Product Catalog* group.
#. There you can configure the sales amount ranges that a product has to acomplish to
   be consider in each sales classification group.
#. By default, a period of 365 days will be evaluated, but it can be set here as
   well.
#. We can also set a minimum product life in the *Sales classification days to ignore*
   setting.

A cron is available to schedule the classification evaluation periodically. Go to
*Settings > Technical > Automation > Scheduled Actions* and set the *Classify products
by sales* cron to your preferred settings.
