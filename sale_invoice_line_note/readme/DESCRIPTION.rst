This module adds a checkbox 'Copy notes to invoice' in the create invoice
wizard from the sale order, to propagate sale order line of 'Note' type to the
created invoice.

**IMPORTANT**

This module is useless since
https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/ff4f1eafd222555b6c13503a9d7253403899bcee
and Odoo now always creates invoice lines for notes.
