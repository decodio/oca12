The configuration of the rules is done in "Inventory > Configuration > Stock Reservation Rules".

Creation of a rule:

Properties that define where the rule will be applied:

* Location: Define where the rule will look for goods (a parent of the move's source location).
* Rule Domain: The rule is used only if the Stock Move matches the domain.

Removal rules for the locations:

* Quants Domain: this domain includes/excludes quants based on a domain.
* Advanced Removal Strategy: the strategy that will be used for this location
  and sub-location when the rule is used.

The sequences have to be sorted in the view list to define the reservation priorities.
