This module adds the concept of equivalent category. A product can
belong to a certain equivalent category and all products in that
category will be considered equivalent. The concept of equivalent products
can be used in other parts of Odoo, i.e., in a Manufacturing Order if there
is no stock for a component, make the system propose an equivalent product
that has quantity on hand, instead.
